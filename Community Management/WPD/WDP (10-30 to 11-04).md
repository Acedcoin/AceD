# Weekly Polis (10/30 to 11/04) 
---
## Polis Core
* The Polis Core team released the Polis Core Wallet v1.4.6 after some bug fixes on previous issues that emerged from the PoS hard fork. Here's the link: https://github.com/polispay/polis/releases/tag/v1.4.6
* Cryptopia is now open for Polis!

* We've published an article on Medium called "The Road from PoW to PoS" in which we speak in detail of when we decided to change from PoW to PoS, the reasons and how we managed to do the hard fork. We hope this will clear any questions regarding this change any of you might have. Here's the link: https://medium.com/@PolisBlockchain/the-road-from-pow-to-pos-ee5f8fa5142e

## PolisPay
### PolisPay Team
* As we said last week, the team is working in perfeting small details of the app but the core features are ready.
* Internal testing continues.
* As a reminder, we'd like to say that for the people that have the previous version of the app, we'll publish steps on how to make the transition when the new version is live.

### PolisPay Beta
*The PolisPay Team is working on fixing small details of the app. They're working on a funcionality for you to be able to buy the PolisPay Card straight from the app.
* The PolisPay Beta testers are still making purchases with their PolisPay Card, check the Polis Twitter and Instagram to see what they are buying!
* Some of the Beta Testers have received their cards and are now waiting for the app to launch so they can begin testing. Soon the other testers will receive their cards.

## Community Management & Outreach
* Polis is now listed on the Stakinglab.io platform!
* We've been working on a Polis Wiki. The web site is up but we'll be posting new content through time.
