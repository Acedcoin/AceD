Good evening guys, here are some updates:
- Articles must arrive Tuesday (10/16)
- The videos made by youtubers should be produced after the transition from POW to POS.
- As everyone knows the attack on the Polis network has caused a shock in every community, to bring greater security to new investors we wait for the fork and the release of transactions in crypto to make the videos.
- While we will continue the other subjects so that the fork occurs everything okay for the videos and the prizes.
- As soon as the articles arrive I will be posting more updates about the project
Thanks to all for your understanding !
