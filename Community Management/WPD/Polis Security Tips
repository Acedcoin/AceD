To all Polis-Coin interested. At the weekend again users were deceived with fake accounts. Before you buy Polis Coins, first of all, you have a secure operating system. Upgrade from Windows 7 + 8 to 10 for free. Or alternatively use a free Linux. Build a Windows PE live system, which only starts from the USB stick. Computers with several family members (users), I advise to use them. Always avoid Internet caf√©s or all public computers. Familiarize yourself with safe password handling outside the computer! First write passwords on paper first and then transfer them to the program for encrypting the wallet. Encrypted copies (with Keepass, 7Zip ...) on several USB sticks of the passwords and the wallet. Generally do not store passwords on the PC. Safe passwords have more than 24 characters or take a very long sentence that only you know. Generally tell nobody if you have cryptocoins. Need your help, never share personal information, passwords ... Blackened, always cuts desktopprints before sending. Polis Support never sends setup files directly and never asks for passwords or personal information. Always skeptical and careful of your Internet counterparts. Always read the FAQ of polis and pinned info. Everything important is deposited there.
